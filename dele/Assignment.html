   <h1>MY ROLE MODEL BY TEAM GOLD
   </h1> 
   <h2>My Role Model by Obatoyinbo Dele Jacob</h2>
   <p>My role model are my parents.I want to imitate
    thier love and kindness they show for me and my siblings
    and thier generousity they show for me and my siblings.
    They provide even if we have guests or people to feed 
    they provide for all and no partiality they also disciline 
    us,although i dont like it it will me become better
    in the future.I also want to imitate them because of 
    their tolerance even if i offend them seriously they correct
    me and dont seriously beat me.Another reason is because of thier
    hard work and advise they give to me and all my siblings.And i also enjoy
    the priviledge of having a good education and not being subjected to
    child abuse or slavery or any form of abuse,i am grateful that my parent also
    accomodate me,and i am also grateful for the chance of growing up in a christian home.When i grow up and by God's grace become successful i will
    give my parents the best life ever ,thanking them for the best life they gave me.
